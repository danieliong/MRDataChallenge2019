abstract = {HDLs are heterogeneous subpopulations of discrete particles that differ quantitatively and qualitatively in apolipoprotein and lipid composition 1. Although HDL particles conventionally are characterized by their choles terol content (HDL-C), the cholesterol transported within HDL particles does not participate directly in the multifarious atheroprotective functions of HDL 2-4. Genetically modified animal models have contributed substantially to our understanding of HDL structure and function, and in particular to understanding how apolipoproteins, apolipoprotein receptors, lipid-transfer proteins, cholesterol transporters, and enzymatic pathways affect atherosclerotic lesion development 5. Some results from these studies are conflicting, which probably reflects variations in study design, dietary interventions, genetic background, and species (TABLE 1). Epidemiologically, HDL-C level in plasma is a superb marker or predictor of risk of cardiovascular disease, but the role of HDL as a causative factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) has been called into question. Research into HDL monogenic disorders has shown variable associations between HDL-C levels and risk of ASCVD, and these associations are determined by specific pathways that modulate HDL structure and function 5. In meta-analyses of Mendelian randomiza-tion studies in the general population, dysfunctional variants in various genes that alter HDL-C levels show no consistent relationship with coronary heart disease (CHD) events 6-8. We need, therefore, to consider and reassess our preconceptions of how these complex HDL pathways are associated with the risk of atherosclerosis. In this Review, we consider the opportunities afforded by human genetic studies, through an emphasis on systems biology, to understand, and perhaps solve, the broader conundrum posed by HDL and its role in ASCVD 9. Monogenic disorders of HDL Advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in cholesterol efflux and the patho-physiology of monogenic dyslipoproteinaemia have Abstract | Plasma levels of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) predict the risk of cardiovascular disease at the epidemiological level, but a direct causal role for HDL in cardiovascular disease remains controversial. Studies in animal models and humans with rare monogenic disorders link only particular HDL-associated mechanisms with causality, including those mechanisms related to particle functionality rather than cholesterol content. Mendelian randomization studies indicate that most genetic variants that affect a range of pathways that increase plasma HDL-C levels are not usually associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, with some exceptions, such as cholesteryl ester transfer protein variants. Furthermore, only a fraction of HDL-C variation has been explained by known loci from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), suggesting the existence of additional pathways and targets. Systems genetics can enhance our understanding of the spectrum of HDL pathways, particularly those pathways that involve new and non-obvious GWAS loci. Bioinformatic approaches can also define new molecular interactions inferred from both large-scale genotypic data and RNA sequencing data to reveal biologically meaningful gene modules and networks governing HDL metabolism with direct relevance to disease end points. Targeting these newly recognized causal networks might inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

@techreport{Zhao2018,
abstract = {Background. Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effect of risk exposures in epidemiology. Two-sample summary-data MR that uses publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data have become a popular design in practice. With the sample size of GWAS continuing to increase, it is now possible to utilize genetic instruments that are only weakly associated with the exposure. Methods. To maximize the statistical power of MR, we propose a genome-wide design where more than a thousand genetic instruments are used. For the statistical analysis, we use an empirical partially Bayes approach where instruments are weighted according to their true strength, thus weak instruments bring less variation to the estimator. The final estimator is highly efficient in the presence of many weak genetic instruments and is robust to balanced and/or sparse pleiotropy. Results. We apply our method to estimate the causal effect of body mass index (BMI) and major blood lipids on cardiovascular disease outcomes. Compared to previous MR studies, we obtain much more precise causal effect estimates and substantially shorter confidence intervals. Some new and statistically significant findings are: the estimated causal odds ratio of BMI on ischemic stroke is 1.19 (95{\%} CI: 1.07-1.32, p-value ≤ 0.001); the estimated causal odds ratio of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) on coronary artery disease (CAD) is 0.78 (95{\%} CI 0.73-0.84, p-value ≤ 0.001). However, the estimated effect of HDL-C becomes substantially smaller and statistically non-significant when we only use the strong instruments. Conclusions. By employing a genome-wide design and robust statistical methods, the statistical power of MR studies can be greatly improved. Our empirical results suggest that, even though the relationship between HDL-C and CAD appears to be highly heterogeneous, it may be too soon to completely dismiss the HDL hypothesis. Further investigations are needed to demystify the observational and genetic associations between HDL-C and CAD. Key messages: • We utilize common variants across the whole genome (typically over a thousand) as instrumental variables. • We extend a previously proposed method-robust adjusted profile score-to account for the measurement error in GWAS summary data and biases due to weak instruments. A new method-empirical partially Bayes-is developed to increase the statistical power when some genetic instruments are strong but many are very weak. The estimator is robust to balanced and/or sparse pleiotropy. • Our new and more powerful analysis greatly improves the precision of the causal effect estimates of BMI and blood lipids on cardiovascular disease outcomes. • Code to replicate the results (including diagnostics) is available in the R package mr.raps (https: //github.com/qingyuanzhao/mr.raps). 2},

abstract = {Plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides are among the most important risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) and are targets for therapeutic intervention. We screened the genome for common variants associated with plasma lipids in {\textgreater}100,000 individuals of European ancestry. Here we report 95 significantly associated loci (P {\textless} 5 x 10(-8)), with 59 showing genome-wide significant association with lipid traits for the first time. The newly reported associations include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near known lipid regulators (for example, CYP7A1, NPC1L1 and SCARB1) as well as in scores of loci not previously implicated in lipoprotein metabolism. The 95 loci contribute not only to normal variation in lipid traits but also to extreme lipid phenotypes and have an impact on lipid traits in three non-European populations (East Asians, South Asians and African Americans). Our results identify several novel loci associated with plasma lipids that are also associated with CAD. Finally, we validated three of the novel genes-GALNT2, PPP1R3B and TTC39B-with experiments in mouse models. Taken together, our findings provide the foundation to develop a broader biological understanding of lipoprotein metabolism and to identify new therapeutic opportunities for the prevention of CAD.},

To identify new loci and refine known loci influencing these lipids, we examined 188,577 individuals using genome-wide and custom genotyping arrays. We identify and annotate 157 loci associated with lipid levels at P {\textless} 5 × 10(-8), including 62 loci not previously associated with lipid levels in humans. Using dense genotyping in individuals of European, East Asian, South Asian and African ancestry, we narrow association signals in 12 loci. We find that loci associated with blood lipid levels are often associated with cardiovascular and metabolic traits, including coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, blood pressure, waist-hip ratio and body mass index. Our results demonstrate the value of using genetic data from individuals of diverse ancestry and provide insights into the biological mechanisms regulating blood lipids to guide future genetic, biological and therapeutic research.},

In addition to confirming most known CAD-associated loci, we identified ten new loci (eight additive and two recessive) that contain candidate causal genes newly implicating biological processes in vessel walls. We observed intralocus allelic heterogeneity but little evidence of low-frequency variants with larger effects and no evidence of synthetic association. Our analysis provides a comprehensive survey of the fine genetic architecture of CAD, showing that genetic susceptibility to this common disease is largely determined by common SNPs of small effect size.},

 abstract = {The Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm is a modification of the EM algorithm where the expectation in the E-step is computed numerically through Monte Carlo simulations. The most flexible and generally applicable approach to obtaining a Monte Carlo sample in each iteration of an MCEM algorithm is through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routines such as the Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings samplers. Although MCMC estimation presents a tractable solution to problems where the E-step is not available in closed form, two issues arise when implementing this MCEM routine: (1) how do we minimize the computational cost in obtaining an MCMC sample? and (2) how do we choose the Monte Carlo sample size? We address the first question through an application of importance sampling whereby samples drawn during previous EM iterations are recycled rather than running an MCMC sampler each MCEM iteration. The second question is addressed through an application of regenerative simulation. We obtain approximate independent and identical samples by subsampling the generated MCMC sample during different renewal periods. Standard central limit theorems may thus be used to gauge Monte Carlo error. In particular, we apply an automated rule for increasing the Monte Carlo sample size when the Monte Carlo error overwhelms the EM estimate at any given iteration. We illustrate our MCEM algorithm through analyses of two datasets fit by generalized linear mixed models. As a part of these applications, we demonstrate the improvement in computational cost and efficiency of our routine over alternative MCEM strategies.},
